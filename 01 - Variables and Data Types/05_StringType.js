// String Type Data
// The String data type represents a sequence of zero or more 16-bit Unicode characters. Strings can be
// delineated by either double quotes (“) or single quotes (‘), so both of the following are legal:-

var firstName = "Pradip";
var lastName = "Chaudhary";
console.log(firstName);
console.log(typeof firstName);
